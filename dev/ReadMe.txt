Because I started this semester without participating in rbesenci's Introduction to Programming course, I was a bit left behind.
Due to this, i didn't manage to make the last few drills in time.
Fortunately I could catch up with last semester's classes before and this semester's classes at the holidays. 
I hope this could be forgiven after a good drill defense :)
